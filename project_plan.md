# Project: The Automated Business Assistant

This project aims to create an AI assistant that helps manage your business, starting with professional email communication.

## Phase 1: The Email Responder

Our first goal is to build a tool that can read incoming emails, understand them, and draft professional replies, especially for tricky situations like customer disputes.

### How it will work (The Big Picture):

1.  **Connect to your Email:** The tool will need secure access to your email inbox to read new messages.
2.  **Understand the Email:** We'll use a powerful AI (like Perplexity's API) to analyze the email's content and tone. Is it a simple question? A complaint? A new business opportunity?
3.  **Draft a Professional Reply:** Based on the analysis, the AI will draft a high-quality, professional response. For disputes, it will use a calm and helpful tone.
4.  **Review and Send:** Initially, the drafted emails will be saved for you to review and send. Once you're confident in the AI, we can work on making this step fully automatic.

### What We Need to Build (The Pieces):

*   **A Secure Connection:** A script to safely log in to your email account.
*   **The "Brain":** A script that takes the email content and sends it to an AI service (like Perplexity) to get back a drafted reply.
*   **The "Orchestrator":** The main script that runs automatically, checks for new emails, and uses the other pieces to process them.
